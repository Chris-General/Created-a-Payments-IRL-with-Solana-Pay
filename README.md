# Created-a-Payments-IRL-with-Solana-Pay
It's awesome learning from Pointer

A great tutorial successfully competed...
Pointer:
We’re going to build a point-of-sale web app that allows us to take payments from customers in person. We’ll present a QR code that they can scan with a Solana wallet to make the payment. As soon as they do our app will update to show that they’ve paid. It’s pretty magic, and you’ll see just how easy it is to make it work!

We’re also going to look at online payments in Solana, and build a loyalty card scheme. You can do things like give users a 50% discount on every 5th purchase. Or whatever you like really, it’s super flexible. We’ll finish up with a sneak peek at some really cool upcoming Solana Pay functionality that pulls all of this together!
